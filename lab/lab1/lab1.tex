\section{Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Test the behavior that the resistance has to temperature, humidity, high current and voltage.
	\item Understand what happened when a series of capacitors behave at different conditions.
	\item Analyze the behavior of a simple array of resistors.
\end{itemize}

\section{Experiment procedures}

\subsection{Resistor behavior}
We are going to test the behavior that the resistance has to temperature, humidity, high current and voltage. By using a resistor of 220$\unit{\Omega}$, 10$\unit{k\Omega}$ and the closest to 1$\unit{\Omega}$, perform the follow set of tests.
\begin{itemize}
	\item  
	By using a wave generator and an oscilloscope, measure the resistor response for
a voltage of 1, 5, 10 and 15 V by sweeping the frequency from 10 Hz up to 50
MHz in each case.
	\item  
	In each case heat or warm the resistance and see if there is any change in the
oscilloscope signal.
	\item
	``Carefully'' reduce the temperature of the resistance and see what happen to the
signal.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Capacitors}
The second part considers the use of capacitors. In here, we are going to use a series of
capacitors and to understand what happened when they behave at different conditions.

\begin{itemize}
	\item
	Use the capacitors: 0.1 $\unit{\mu F}$, 4.7 pF and 3.3$\unit{\mu F}$. Each one of the capacitors is to be in series with a 10 $\unit{k\Omega}$ resistor. By applying 1 $V_{pp}$ you’re going to sweep the frequency ranging from 50 MHz or the highest to 60 Hz.
	\item
	Invert the order of the devices and perform the same test.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Array of resistors}
Finally, with an inductor, we are going to perform a set of experiments. By using
a simple array of a 10 kΩ resistor in series with an inductor, we’re going to analyze
the behavior of the array. By using the wave generator, we are sweeping a range of
frequencies from 50 MHz up to 1 Hz with a 1 $V_{pp}$ .

\subsection{Ramp Response}

\subsection{Sine Response}
The data was shown in Table \ref{tab-4}.

\begin{table}[htbp]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
		\hline
		Frequency (Hz) & Vout / Vin & Time Shift ($\mu s$) & Phase Shift ($^\circ$) \\
		\hline
		50 & 10.2 / 10.6 = 0.9623 & 880 & -15.84 \\
		\hline
		500 & 3.12 / 10.2  = 0.3059 & 380 & -68.40 \\
		\hline
		5k & 0.385 / 10.1 = 0.0381 & 46 & -82.80\\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Sine Response}
	\label{tab-4}
\end{table}

In this table, phase shift is calculated according the equation

$$\sphericalangle=-2\pi f_c\Delta t RC \frac{180}{\pi}=-f_c\Delta t\cdot 3.6\times10^{-4}$$

\section{Error analysis and discussion}
\subsection{Step Response}
In ideal situation, we know
$$V_{in}(t)=u(t)$$
$$V_{out}(t)=y_{step}(t)=(1-e^{-t/RC})u(t)$$

Then we can substitute $R=1k\Omega$, $C=1\mu F$ into $y_{step}(t)$ and plot the ideal graph when $t\in[0,0.005)$ in MATLAB, as Figure \ref{fig-1-ideal}.

%\begin{figure}[htbp]
%	\centering
%	\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{ideal_1.png}
%	\caption{Ideal graph of step response}
%	\label{fig-1-ideal}
%\end{figure}

We can find that in Figure \ref{fig-1} (experimental), $V_{in}(t)$ was not a straight line, it is probably because of the inner resistance of the experiment instruments. The shape of $V_{out}(t)$ in two figures are very similar.

\subsection{Pulse Response}
In the experiment, we can only simulate a $\delta$ function since instantaneous time period doesn't exist in real world. However, the smaller time period (width) we get, the more accurate the experiment is. \\

The ideal graphs of $h(t)$ with a width were shown in Figure \ref{fig-2-ideal-width}. They are similar to those in the experiment.\\


%\begin{figure}[htbp]
%	\centering
%	\subfigure[Width: 1ms, A: 100mV]{
%		\includegraphics[width=0.45\linewidth]{ideal_2_width_1.png}
%		\label{fig-2-ideal-width-1}
%	}
%	\subfigure[Width: 0.5ms, A: 200mV]{
%		\includegraphics[width=0.45\linewidth]{ideal_2_width_2.png}
%		\label{fig-2-ideal-width-2}
%	}
%	\caption{Ideal Pulse Response in experiment}
%	\label{fig-2-ideal-width}
%\end{figure}

We know the equation of the pulse response is

$$h(t)=\frac{dy_{step}(t)}{dt}=\frac{1}{RC}e^{-t/RC}u(t)$$

The ideal graph of $h(t)$ was shown in Figure \ref{fig-2-ideal}. It is similar to the figure when width $\to 0$.

%\begin{figure}[htbp]
%	\centering
%	\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{ideal_2.png}
%	\caption{Ideal graph of pulse response}
%	\label{fig-2-ideal}
%\end{figure}

\newpage

\subsection{Ramp Response}

A period of the ramp function in this experiment is
$$x(t)=\frac{0.1}{0.01}(t-0.005)=10(t-0.005)$$
$$y(t)=x(t)*h(t)$$
The ideal graph of $y(t)$ was shown in Figure \ref{fig-3-ideal}. It fits the figure in the experiment well.

%\begin{figure}[htbp]
%	\centering
%	\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{ideal_3.png}
%	\caption{Ideal graph of ramp response}
%	\label{fig-3-ideal}
%\end{figure}

\subsection{Sine Response}

Theoretically, we have
$$\frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}}=\sqrt{1+(2\pi f_cRC)^2}$$
$$\Delta t=\frac{\arctan(2\pi f_cRC)}{2\pi f_cRC}$$
$$\sphericalangle=-\arctan(2\pi f_cRC)$$

Then we can calculate the theoretic value in Table \ref{tab-4-ideal}.

\begin{table}[htbp]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
		\hline
		Frequency (Hz) & Vout / Vin & Time Shift ($\mu s$) & Phase Shift ($^\circ$) \\
		\hline
		50 & 0.9540 & 968.9 & -17.4406 \\
		\hline
		500 & 0.3033 & 401.9 & -72.3432 \\
		\hline
		5k & 0.0318& 49.0 & -88.1768\\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Ideal Sine Response}
	\label{tab-4-ideal}
\end{table}

Comparing the results of Table \ref{tab-4} and Table \ref{tab-4-ideal}, we can get a table of error in Table \ref{tab-4-error}

\begin{table}[htbp]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
		\hline
		Frequency (Hz) & Vout / Vin & Time Shift & Phase Shift  \\
		\hline
		50 & 0.9\% & 9.2\% & 9.1\% \\
		\hline
		500 & 0.9\% & 5.5\% & 5.4\% \\
		\hline
		5k & 19.8\% & 6.1\% & 6.1\% \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Sine Response Error}
	\label{tab-4-error}
\end{table}

There is a significant error in $V_{out} / V_{in}$ when $f=5000$, it is probably because the value of $V_{out}$ is too small so that the system error of the experiment equipment is scaled.

\section{Conclusion}

In this experiment, we achieved a lot.\\

First, we became familiar with the laboratory equipment: power supply, signal generator, digital oscilloscope. We reviewed basic concepts of linear time-invariant systems. We illustrated several possible ways to determine the impulse response of a physical system from measured data.We recalled how to build a RC circuit as we did in VE215 course, and recorded out results into a usb disk. They are all basic skills in a Signals \& Systems Lab.\\

Second, we used linearity, time-invariance and impulse response to compute the output of an LTI system when the input is a step, a pulse, or a more complicated signal. We measured the frequency response of an LTI system and compare against theory.\\

In the part of Step Response, we found that the measured $V_{in}(t)$ curve was not a straight line as the theory. It is probably because of the system error of the laboratory equipment which can't be cancelled. \\

In the part of Pulse Response, we compared the figures when we use different width for the pulse and realize the simulation of the pulse signal. We concluded the relationship between the figure we got and the width we set.\\

In the part of Ramp Response, we calculated the convolution of $x(t)$ and $h(t)$ and compared the result $y(t)=x(t)*h(t)$ with the experiment result.\\

In the part of Sine Response, we calculated the ratio of $V_{out}$ and $V_{in}$, the time shift and the phase shift and compared them with the experimental ones. Some apparent errors occurred when the frequency becomes larger. It is probably because of the value of $R$ and $C$ is not accurate in the experiment.
